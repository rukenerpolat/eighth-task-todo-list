## ABOUT
 
Before starting the project, I looked through [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1287029163993360080) examples on Google. I chose a design I liked and wrote down the project requirements based on it. 
> I mainly focused on the JavaScript part, so although the CSS could use a few minor improvements, the project is ready to be submitted as it is.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to create an interactive task list where users can easily add tasks, mark them as completed, prioritize, and filter them.

## Features

- Starts with an empty task list  
- Ability to add new tasks (Title required, priority selection required)  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete tasks  
- Tasks are labeled according to priority (Low, Medium, High)  
- Search function for tasks  
- Filter between completed and incomplete tasks  
- Dark / Light theme toggle  
- Responsive design with mobile compatibility (minor improvements possible)  
- Modal popup for adding tasks  
- Dynamic task management using event delegation  
- Error handling and form validation (Prevents adding empty tasks or tasks without priority)

## Notes

- The project does not use localStorage; tasks are cleared when the page reloads.  
- Dynamically added elements are managed with event delegation.  
- Dark mode and light mode can be toggled.  
- Priority order is `Low | Medium | High`.
